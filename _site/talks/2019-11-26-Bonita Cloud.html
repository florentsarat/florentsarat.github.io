<p>At the beginning of 2020, I participated in the launch of the brand new Cloud offer for the Bonita BPMN platform presentation.</p>

<p>During the Bonita day, which is an event hosted by Bonitasoft where customers, partners, and prospects attend, I presented the capacities of our new offer.</p>

<p>I’ve also made a quick demonstration of the platform’s strong Continuous Delivery capacities that allow users to deliver easily automation.</p>
