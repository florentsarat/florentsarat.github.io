<p>As a product manager, you are responsible for identifying the most important problems to solve but also to drive the development of the right solution. It’s an exciting role, but it’s also one that requires careful decision-making and balancing of competing priorities. One way to achieve this is through pragmatism.</p>

<p>Pragmatism is a philosophy that emphasizes practicality and real-world consequences, rather than relying on abstract concepts or theories. It’s about making decisions based on what works best in the real world, rather than being overly idealistic or dogmatic.</p>

<p>Here are three ways that pragmatism can help a PM:</p>

<h3 id="focus-on-delivering-value-to-customers">Focus on delivering value to customers</h3>

<p>One of the core principles of pragmatism is to focus on what is practical and useful. In the context of product management, this means prioritizing features and functionality that will deliver the most value to your users. Rather than trying to build the perfect product, you should focus on creating something that meets your users’ needs and solves their problems.</p>

<p>To achieve this, you need to have a deep understanding of your users’ needs and pain points. Use customer feedback, user research, and data analysis to inform your decisions. It’s important to be flexible and open to feedback. You must also have empathy to understand the pain associated with the problem and quantify the importance of the issue and therefore the ability of the users to live with the issue or not.</p>

<h3 id="balance-short-term-and-long-term-goals">Balance short-term and long-term goals</h3>
<p>Another key aspect of pragmatism is balancing short-term and long-term goals. As a product manager, you need to balance the need to deliver immediate results with the need to build a sustainable business. It’s easy to get caught up in short-term goals, such as hitting kpis targets or launching new features, but you also need to think about the long-term health of your product and your company.</p>

<p>To achieve this, you need to set clear goals and priorities for your product. Identify what you need to achieve in the short term and what you need to do to build a strong foundation for the future. This might mean making some trade-offs or saying no to certain features or initiatives that don’t align with your long-term goals.</p>

<p>However, as a product manager, you must also avoid pushing back any changes because in the long-term vision gets in the way. Some long-term visions are reached after several years of work. In some cases, you cannot let those problems unsolved in the meantime as it might lead to the demise of the project! The goal of any company is to last.</p>

<p>It is the classic: “yes, but one day we will have this super duper feature that will solve your problem”. The issue is that it may take to long to have this feature or as we all know long-term vision can change… So your users might wait and have nothing in the end!</p>

<p>You have to build short/mid-term solutions but you need to take into their impact on the long-term vision and plan how they will evolve the rest of the product.</p>

<p>The path to the long-term vision isn’t a straight line!</p>

<h3 id="embrace-experimentation-and-learning">Embrace experimentation and learning</h3>
<p>Finally, pragmatism encourages experimentation and learning. Rather than trying to predict the future or relying on assumptions, you should be willing to try new things and learn from the results. This means being open to feedback and data, and using that information to inform your decisions.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to take risks. CI/CD, feature flagging, the agility of the teams… all these allow teams to make quick and efficient changes to today’s product. Take advantage of those possibilities.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Pragmatism is a valuable philosophy for product managers. By focusing on delivering value to users, balancing short-term and long-term goals, and embracing experimentation and learning, you can build products that meet the needs of your users and create long-term success for your company. Remember, it’s not about being perfect, but about being practical and making decisions that work in the real world to deliver a useful and meaningful solutions to your users.</p>
