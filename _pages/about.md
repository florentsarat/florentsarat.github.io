## About me

I'm Florent. I have been working in product management for more than a decade in various domains (fintech, production industry, automation tech, and construction tech) on different types of products (SaaS, PaaS, rich clients, APIs).

I've created this personal website to mostly play with Jenkill. Indeed, I enjoy getting my hands 'dirty' and trying different techs so I'll probably use this website to also share my different projects.

Don't hesitate to reach out through [my Linkedin account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florent-sarat/)
