Worked in team where our goal was to validate functionally the regulation system software of the M88 (aircraft engine).

 My different activities were:

- Functional specification analysis
- Tests creation and documentation (procedure and results)
- Testing result analysis 
- Testing on bench and Simulink/matlab

All the testing was done under the DO 178B standard as the system tested was a critical one. Therefore it was critical to be precise and rigorous in all actions.

The deadline were short but the mission was successful as the system was validated and certified.
