At the beginning of 2020, I participated in the launch of the brand new Cloud offer for the Bonita BPMN platform presentation.

During the Bonita day, which is an event hosted by Bonitasoft where customers, partners, and prospects attend, I presented the capacities of our new offer.

I've also made a quick demonstration of the platform's strong Continuous Delivery capacities that allow users to deliver easily automation.
